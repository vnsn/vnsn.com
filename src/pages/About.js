      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <div className="about content" >

        <p>I have a master's degree in business administration with a concentration in marketing, so I speak both "technology" and "business."</p>

        <p>I just finished the full-stack JavaScript web development bootcamp at <a href="http://vschool.io/">V School</a> in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States. I am also working on <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/">Harvard's CS50X</a> course. I'd taken a few programming courses in the past but recently decided to focus full-time on turning my dream of becoming a software engineer into reality.</p>

        <h3>Long-time nerd</h3>
        <p>I have worked in or around the technology industry for most of my adult life. I've created and managed several personal, professional, and <a href="https://nothingbutdirt.com/">hobby</a> websites, helped friends set up WordPress sites, managed company intranets, and had the title of Webmaster a couple of times. I even used to run an <a href="http://twiki.org/">in-home wiki</a> to keep track of my house projects.</p>

        <h3>Talked out of computer science</h3>
        <p>I took a few computer science classes in college <a href="https://www.ucsc.edu/">(University of California at Santa Cruz)</a> and fell in love. I started spending time on BBS's and worked in the campus computer lab. I considered switching to CS but was talked out of it by my boyfriend who convinced me that I shouldn't want to be a programmer.</p>

        <h3>Side hustle</h3>
        <p>While I looked for my first full-time job out of college, I made money by building and fixing computers. One of my customers was a mortgage broker who hired me as a loan processor. There, I helped co-workers learn Windows, Word, and Excel, and built computers for them on the side.</p>

        <h3>Secretly a hardcore nerd</h3>
        <p>After a couple of years, I realized my mistake in not pursuing CS. I convinced Logitech to hire me as a technical support representative for pointing devices and loved it. I was good at finding, documenting, and reproducing bugs and was loaned out to Quality Assurance. I thought I might want to be a firmware engineer, so I started reading a system architecture book on my lunch breaks.</p>

        <h3>Back to school for CS degree</h3>
        <p>I then spent three years taking all the lower division courses I needed for a computer science bachelor's degree, including all the calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, discrete math, and physics courses, with a plan to continue to a master's degree in computer engineering. I had gone from technical support at Logitech, to software technical support, then engineering services, and then enterprise software project management. My long-term plan was to become a Vice President of Engineering and then a tech company CEO.</p>

        <h3>Talked out of CS . . .  AGAIN!</h3>
        <p>I had started taking upper division courses toward San Jose State University's computer science bachelor's degree when I ended up on a long flight with the CEO of a tech company that had gone public. He convinced me that the best tech CEOs came from Marketing, not Engineering, and that I should be getting a master's of business administration instead. I "shouldn't want to be a programmer." Since I was focused on my long-term goal of CEO, I went with his advice. I quit SJSU and completed the MBA program at <a href="https://www.scu.edu/business/mba-degrees/">Santa Clara University</a>.</p>

        <h3>Identity crisis</h3>
        <p>A couple of years after getting my MBA I realized I still wanted to be a programmer, which led to a bit of an identity crisis. I had worked so hard on pursuing a computer science degree and let myself get talked out of it again(!), then got the MBA only to realize that it might have been a mistake.</p>

        <h3>Life lesson</h3>
        <p>What I learned is that we need to follow our <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>own</span> passion. Don't let anyone talk us out of it. Steve Jobs' <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2005/06/14/jobs-061505/">2005 Stanford University commencement address</a> touched me deeply. "You’ve got to find what you love...the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it."</p>

        <h3>Confusion</h3>
        <p>I <span style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>had</span> found it, but I was confused because I had been convinced that I "shouldn't want to be a programmer." That's when I decided to follow my passion for motorcycle racing instead.</p>

        <h3>Motorcycle Racing</h3>
        <p>At the time, I was a huge fan, but only knew one person who worked in the industry. His <a href="http://www.motospectator.com/">advice and introductions</a> led me to co-creating a supermoto race program for KTM Sportmotorcycle. It was a creation borne out of my persistence and my passion for racing. A year later, Miller Motorsports Park (a motorcycle, car, and kart racetrack) in Utah hired me over four local candidates and relocated me to manage motorcycle racing and be the assistant director over all racing. Being female and not being a racer initially caused some resistance within the racing community. My only racing experience was that contract with KTM.</p>

        <h3>Still secretly a nerd</h3>
        <p>Over the years, no matter my actual job, I've always managed to incorporate some element of technology into it. For example, when I helped KTM create a new motorcycle race series, I created the first website and race registration form. </p>

        <h3>"Will you be our nerd?"</h3>
        <p>At Miller Motorsports Park I was hired into race operations, but I made so many suggestions for improving the website, and was the "most technical" employee there, that I was moved to Marketing to get a new website created and then manage it. I put the track on social media in 2008 and was the first racetrack marketing manager to "<a href="https://twitter.com/MMP_Utah">live-tweet</a>" a major motorsports event in May 2009. (And possibly the first to live tweet any sporting event. I hadn't heard of any other sport doing it, but I also didn't follow other sports.)</p>

        <h3>Secret nerd once again</h3>
        <p>I've worked in a variety of other jobs since then, but continued to take on some tech tasks. When I managed my friend's door and cabinet hardware business, I took over I.T. duties, including managing the move from Windows to Mac, learning Mac Server so I could manage users and permissions, and then learning how to administer Meraki routers so our two locations could be on the same network. While working for a government contractor in Spain I volunteered at the local <a href="www.rawlpets.com">animal shelter</a> and took over Webmaster duties, creating a new WordPress site for them.</p>

<h3>"Don't settle."</h3>
        <p>I've had some amazing experiences with my diverse background, yet I've waited long enough to make my way back to programming. It's time. I started exploring degree programs and coding bootcamps last year. I was fortunate to be chosen by Adobe for a <a href="https://www.adobe.com/corporate-responsibility/education/digital-academy.html">Digital Academy Scholarship</a>. I might still... ok, I will <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>probably</span>... pursue that CS/CE degree, but a coding bootcamp is helping me pursue my first love <span style={{ fontStyle: "italic", fontWeight: "bold" }} >now</span>. And now is better than later. "Don't settle."</p>

<h3>Want to chat?</h3>
        <p>If you made it this far, maybe we should talk about working together? Send me a message on LinkedIn, or at je at {'{this.domain}'}.</p>

        <p>"Stay hungry. Stay foolish."</p>
