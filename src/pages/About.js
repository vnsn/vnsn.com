      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <div className="about content" >
        <p>I have created and managed different personal, professional, and hobby websites, helped friends set up WordPress sites, managed company intranets, and had the title of Webmaster a couple of times. I've hand-coded sites, used Dreamweaver templates, set up Google Analytics, run Twiki on a home server to organize my life, and used Blogger, Moveable Type, and WordPress. I also have a master's degree in business administration with a concentration in marketing, so I speak both "business" and "technology".</p>

        <p>I've taken a few programming courses over the years, but recently decided to pursue my dream of becoming a full-time developer. I am nearly finished with the full-stack JavaScript web development bootcamp at V School in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States.</p>




        <p>Many years ago, my long-term plan was to become a VP of Engineering and then a tech company CEO. I had spent three years taking all the lower division courses I needed for a computer science bachelor's degree, with a plan to continue with an MS in computer engineering. I had started upper division courses in San Jose State University's part-time program when I ended up on a long flight with the CEO of a tech company that had gone public.</p>


      <p>He convinced me that the best tech CEOs came from Marketing, not Engineering, and that I should be getting an MBA instead. Since I was focused on my long-term goal of CEO, I went with his advice. I quit SJSU and started the MBA program at Santa Clara University in the Fall of 1998. Partway through my degree, I went to work at the company founded by the CEO who convinced me to pursue the MBA. I completed the MBA in three years with a 3.8/4.0 GPA.</p>






        <p>If you made it this far, maybe we should talk about working together?</p>
